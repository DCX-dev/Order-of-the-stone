# 🚀 Quick Release Guide for YouTubers

## How to Get REAL Windows 10/11 Executables

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for release"
git push
```

### Step 2: Wait for GitHub Actions (2-3 minutes)
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **"Actions"** tab at the top
3. Wait for the green checkmark ✅

### Step 3: Download the Executables
1. Click on the latest successful workflow run
2. Scroll down to **"Artifacts"** section
3. Download:
   - **Order_of_the_Stone-Windows** ← This is the REAL Windows 10/11 `.exe`!
   - **Order_of_the_Stone-Mac** ← For Mac users

### Step 4: Share with YouTubers!
- Extract the `.exe` from the zip
- Upload to Google Drive, Dropbox, or itch.io
- Send the link to YouTubers! 🎮

## ⚡ Quick Test

**To test if it's a real Windows executable:**
```bash
file releases/windows/Order_of_the_Stone.exe
```

- ✅ **Good**: "PE32+ executable (console) x86-64" or "PE executable"
- ❌ **Bad**: "Mach-O executable" (this is Mac, not Windows)

**The one built on Mac will say "Mach-O" - that won't work on Windows!**
**The one from GitHub Actions will say "PE32" - that WILL work on Windows 10/11!**

## 🎯 Why GitHub Actions?

- ✅ **FREE** forever
- ✅ Builds on **real Windows servers** (creates true Windows executables)
- ✅ Builds on **real Mac servers** (creates proper Mac apps)
- ✅ Automatic - just push your code!
- ✅ No need for Windows PC

## 📦 What's Included

Both executables have:
- All graphics and animations
- Background music
- Save system
- Multiplayer support
- Villages, monsters, bosses
- Everything!
