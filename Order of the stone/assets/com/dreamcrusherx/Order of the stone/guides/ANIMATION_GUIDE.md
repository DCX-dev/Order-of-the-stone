# üé¨ ANIMATION GUIDE - How to Make Player Animations

## üéØ What I've Added

I've created a complete animation system for your player! Here's what's now working:

### ‚úÖ **Built-in Animations:**
- **Idle** - Standing still (blue)
- **Walk** - 4-frame walking animation (blue variations)
- **Jump** - 3-frame jumping animation (green)
- **Fall** - 2-frame falling animation (red)
- **Attack** - 3-frame attacking animation (orange)

### üéÆ **How to Use:**
1. **Press T** to open the full inventory
2. **Right-click** inventory items to add them to crafting
3. **Craft a pickaxe** with 3 stone + 2 oak planks
4. **Watch your player animate** as you move around!

## üé® **How to Make Your Own Animations**

### **Step 1: Create Animation Frames**
You need multiple images for each animation. For example, a walking animation might have:
- Frame 1: Left foot forward
- Frame 2: Standing straight
- Frame 3: Right foot forward
- Frame 4: Standing straight

### **Step 2: Replace Placeholder Animations**
In the code, find this section and replace the colored rectangles with your textures:

```python
def setup_animations(self):
    # Idle animation
    idle_frames = [
        load_texture("assets/player/idle_1.png"),
        load_texture("assets/player/idle_2.png"),
        load_texture("assets/player/idle_3.png")
    ]
    self.animations["idle"] = Animation(idle_frames, 0.2)
    
    # Walking animation
    walk_frames = [
        load_texture("assets/player/walk_1.png"),
        load_texture("assets/player/walk_2.png"),
        load_texture("assets/player/walk_3.png"),
        load_texture("assets/player/walk_4.png")
    ]
    self.animations["walk"] = Animation(walk_frames, 0.15)
```

### **Step 3: Animation Speed Control**
- **Lower numbers** = Faster animation (0.05 = very fast)
- **Higher numbers** = Slower animation (0.3 = slow)
- **0.1** = 10 frames per second (good for walking)

### **Step 4: Add New Animation Types**
Want a "dancing" animation? Add this:

```python
# Dancing animation
dance_frames = [
    load_texture("assets/player/dance_1.png"),
    load_texture("assets/player/dance_2.png"),
    load_texture("assets/player/dance_3.png")
]
self.animations["dance"] = Animation(dance_frames, 0.1)
```

## üé≠ **Animation Triggers**

The system automatically switches animations based on:

- **Idle**: Standing still
- **Walk**: Moving left/right on ground
- **Jump**: Moving upward
- **Fall**: Moving downward
- **Attack**: Breaking blocks or attacking

## üñºÔ∏è **Texture Requirements**

- **Size**: 32x32 pixels (TILE_SIZE)
- **Format**: PNG, GIF, or JPG
- **Transparency**: PNG with alpha channel for best results
- **Consistency**: All frames should be the same size

## üöÄ **Advanced Animation Tips**

### **Smooth Transitions**
```python
# Add transition delay between animations
if new_animation != self.current_animation:
    self.transition_timer = 5  # 5 frame delay
    self.current_animation = new_animation
```

### **Animation Events**
```python
# Trigger special effects on specific frames
if self.current_frame == 2 and self.animations["attack"].timer == 0:
    play_sound("attack_sound.wav")
    spawn_particles("attack_effect")
```

### **Variable Speed**
```python
# Make animation speed depend on player speed
walk_speed = 0.15 * (1 + abs(player_velocity))
self.animations["walk"].speed = walk_speed
```

## üéÆ **Current Features**

‚úÖ **Crafting System** - Make pickaxes, swords, armor, and the Olympic Axe!  
‚úÖ **Boss Arena** - Underground arena at world center (coordinates 0,0)  
‚úÖ **Monster Spawning** - Only in new territory, much easier now!  
‚úÖ **Animation System** - Smooth player animations for all actions  
‚úÖ **Bedrock Breaking** - Only with the Olympic Axe (178 stone + 4000 wood)  

## üîß **How to Test**

1. **Run the game**: `python3 order_of_the_stone.py`
2. **Press T** to open full inventory
3. **Right-click** items in your inventory to add to crafting
4. **Craft a pickaxe** with stone + oak planks
5. **Move around** to see animations
6. **Break blocks** to see attack animation
7. **Go to coordinates (0,0)** to find the boss arena

## üé® **Next Steps for You**

1. **Create your own textures** for each animation frame
2. **Replace the colored rectangles** with your artwork
3. **Add more animation types** (dancing, swimming, etc.)
4. **Adjust animation speeds** to match your style
5. **Add sound effects** to animations

The animation system is now fully integrated and will automatically work with your character textures! üé¨‚ú®
