Character Flipping System Test Script
=====================================

This script tests the character flipping system implemented in the main game.
It demonstrates the key features and validates that everything is working correctly.

Features Tested:
- Input handling (A/D keys)
- Facing direction tracking
- Texture flipping
- Held item positioning
- Armor flipping
- Performance optimization
- Debug information
