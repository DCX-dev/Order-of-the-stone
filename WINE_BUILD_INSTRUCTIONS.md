## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Wine is **complex** and **unreliable** for building Windows executables. It often:
- Fails with weird errors
- Creates broken executables
- Takes hours to debug

**GitHub Actions is still the better option** (it's free, no installation, works perfectly).

## üéØ Alternative: Just Release Mac Version First

You can:
1. Release the Mac executable NOW (you already have it!)
2. Tell Windows users "Windows version coming soon!"
3. Build Windows version later when you have access

This is what many indie developers do! üéÆ

## For Now - You Have:

‚úÖ **releases/mac/Order_of_the_Stone** - Works perfectly on Mac
- Has all music, animations, everything
- Ready to share with Mac users

When you can use Wine or GitHub Actions, you'll get the Windows version! üöÄ
